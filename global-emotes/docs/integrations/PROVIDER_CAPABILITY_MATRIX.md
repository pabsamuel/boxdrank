# PROVIDER CAPABILITY MATRIX

Honest, per-provider capability record (master spec §4.1). Statuses: `production_ready` · `credentials_required` · `approval_required` · `creator_authorized_only` · `manual_fallback` · `research_required` · `blocked`. This file is the source of truth mirrored by `packages/provider-sdk` capability declarations and the admin integrations page. **Re-verify against official docs when credentials are configured** — platform terms change.

## Discord — `credentials_required` (production-ready design)

Role-based access: creator links their guild; fans authorize `identify guilds guilds.members.read`; adapter reads the fan's member object in that guild (`GET /users/@me/guilds/{guild.id}/member`) and maps roles → tiers. Bot with Server Members intent enables creator-side sync + webhookless reconciliation via gateway (deferred; polling at v1). No sub verification — roles are the entitlement primitive. Fallback: codes.

## Patreon — `credentials_required`

API v2: creator OAuth exposes campaign + members with tiers (`include=currently_entitled_tiers`); fan-side `identity` with `identity.memberships` shows the fan's own memberships. Webhooks: `members:pledge` create/update/delete, signed (MD5 HMAC — verify per current docs). Both creator-authorized and fan-side paths implemented; fan-side needs the fan to authorize Patreon.

## YouTube — `approval_required` + `creator_authorized_only`

Channel Memberships API (`members.list`, scope `youtube.channel-memberships.creator`) requires Google approval AND creator OAuth. Fan OAuth alone **cannot** enumerate the fan's memberships — do not pretend otherwise. Adapter ships flag-off with creator-side design; until approval: access codes.

## Kick — `research_required` (flag-off)

Official public API launched 2025 with OAuth; subscription-verification capability/scopes unconfirmed at build time. No scraping. Placeholder adapter declares `research_required`; enable only after verifying official docs.

## Access codes (internal) — `production_ready`

Batch generation, expiry, max redemptions, tier mapping, revocation, rate-limited redemption. Universal fallback for every platform above.

## Generic webhook partner (internal) — `production_ready` (flag-off by default)

HMAC-signed partner endpoint: partners POST normalized entitlement events (grant/revoke) with shared-secret signature + timestamp replay window. For future direct platform partnerships.

## Telegram (export, not entitlement) — `credentials_required`

Bot API sticker methods: `createNewStickerSet`/`addStickerToSet`/`deleteStickerFromSet`. Static: PNG/WEBP 512px. Animated: WEBM (VP9) or TGS. Attribution in set title/link. Limitation (documented to creators): removing a sticker stops new distribution, but users who added the set may retain cached copies — full remote wipe is not possible.
